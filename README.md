# The Boba Game!

## Intro

Have you ever wondered what it would be like to make boba? Or are you in need of something to do to pass some time? Never fear: Boba Game is here! In this fun little JS game you are in charge of a brand new 
boba shop. Filled with easter eggs, fun gameplay mechanics, and fun styling, this game could be perfect for you.

## Notes

If you are stuck at any point, you can refer to the Quests section to help you out. While there may not be as many as we'd hope yet, the game is still a WIP. Either way, the "tutorial" gives you a good sense
of how the game works. If the quests don't give enough insight, read the console. You never know what helpful info is in there.

## Roadmap

While there isn't a definitive timeline since this is a personal project and the devs also have school, there is a rough idea of what's gonna be added, so stay tuned for game-changing updates and new features
coming out every so often. There also aren't any socials -_- so no place to look yet. Maybe we'll figure it out. 

 - [x] Effects! Maybe the occasional confetti when you finish a quest, or the buttons bouncing when hovered. These add a level of immersion that will be impressive once completed.
 - [ ] Upgrades! An essential part of every idle game, and one we'll likely add very soon.
 - [ ] Prestige! Maybe a bit of a long shot, but we wouldn't mind doing a prestige system as any amount of incremental-ness is cool.
 - [ ] Saving! Tired of losing precious boba? Let's change that. Saving is a huge part of every incremental game, making life so much easier for those who just want to play occasionally.
 - [ ] Offline Earnings! On the topic of saving, might as well make it so that you can come back to loads of boba- especially once an Auto Seller comes out.
 - [ ] Minigames! (maybe) If added, they'd be quite difficult and come up about once per day, but give monumental rewards.
